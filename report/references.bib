  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Although ultrahigh-throughput RNA-Sequencing has
               become the dominant technology for genome-wide transcriptional
               profiling, the vast majority of RNA-Seq studies typically
               profile only tens of samples, and most analytical pipelines are
               optimized for these smaller studies. However, projects are
               generating ever-larger data sets comprising RNA-Seq data from
               hundreds or thousands of samples, often collected at multiple
               centers and from diverse tissues. These complex data sets
               present significant analytical challenges due to batch and
               tissue effects, but provide the opportunity to revisit the
               assumptions and methods that we use to preprocess, normalize,
               and filter RNA-Seq data - critical first steps for any
               subsequent analysis. RESULTS: We find that analysis of large
               RNA-Seq data sets requires both careful quality control and the
               need to account for sparsity due to the heterogeneity intrinsic
               in multi-group studies. We developed Yet Another RNA
               Normalization software pipeline (YARN), that includes quality
               control and preprocessing, gene filtering, and normalization
               steps designed to facilitate downstream analysis of large,
               heterogeneous RNA-Seq data sets and we demonstrate its use with
               data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.

  abstract  = "MOTIVATION: Gene co-expression measurements are widely used in
               computational biology to identify coordinated expression
               patterns across a group of samples. Coordinated expression of
               genes may indicate that they are controlled by the same
               transcriptional regulatory program, or involved in common
               biological processes. Gene co-expression is generally estimated
               from RNA-Sequencing data, which are commonly normalized to
               remove technical variability. Here, we demonstrate that certain
               normalization methods, in particular quantile-based methods, can
               introduce false-positive associations between genes. These
               false-positive associations can consequently hamper downstream
               co-expression network analysis. Quantile-based normalization
               can, however, be extremely powerful. In particular, when
               preprocessing large-scale heterogeneous data, quantile-based
               normalization methods such as smooth quantile normalization can
               be applied to remove technical variability while maintaining
               global differences in expression for samples with different
               biological attributes. RESULTS: We developed SNAIL
               (Smooth-quantile Normalization Adaptation for the Inference of
               co-expression Links), a normalization method based on smooth
               quantile normalization specifically designed for modeling of
               co-expression measurements. We show that SNAIL avoids formation
               of false-positive associations in co-expression as well as in
               downstream network analyses. Using SNAIL, one can avoid
               arbitrary gene filtering and retain associations to genes that
               only express in small subgroups of samples. This highlights the
               method's potential future impact on network modeling and other
               association-based approaches in large-scale heterogeneous data.

              reducing the dimensionality for increased statistical power and

              Bioconductor and Python package containing computational methods
              to extract these activities within a unified framework. decoupleR
              allows us to flexibly run any method with a given resource,
              including methods that leverage mode of regulation and weights of
              interactions, which are not present in other frameworks.
              Moreover, it leverages OmniPath, a meta-resource comprising over
              100 databases of prior knowledge. Using decoupleR, we evaluated
              the performance of methods on transcriptomic and
              phospho-proteomic perturbation experiments. Our findings suggest
              that simple linear models and the consensus score across top

               are based on the assumption that observed variability in global
               properties is due to technical reasons and are unrelated to the
               biology of interest. For example, some methods correct for
               differences in sequencing read counts by scaling features to
               have similar median values across samples, but these fail to
               reduce other forms of unwanted technical variation. Methods such
               as quantile normalization transform the statistical
               distributions across samples to be the same and assume global
               differences in the distribution are induced by only technical
               variation. However, it remains unclear how to proceed with

               different biological conditions. We also perform a Monte Carlo

               natural language processing, where a corpus of text documents is
               classified into themes or topics using word frequency analysis.
               This approach has proven successful in various biological data
               analysis applications, such as predicting cancer subtypes with
               high accuracy and identifying genes, enhancers, and stable cell
               types simultaneously from sparse single-cell epigenomics data.
               The advantage of using a topic model is that it not only serves
               as a clustering algorithm, but it can also explain clustering
               results by providing word probability distributions over topics.
               Our study proposes a novel topic modeling approach for
               clustering single cells and detecting topics (gene signatures)
               in single-cell datasets that measure multiple omics
               simultaneously. We applied this approach to examine the
               transcriptional heterogeneity of luminal and triple-negative
               breast cancer cells using patient-derived xenograft models with
               acquired resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy.
               Through this approach, we identified protein-coding genes and
               long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that group thousands of cells
               into biologically similar clusters, accurately distinguishing
               drug-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer types. In comparison
               to standard state-of-the-art clustering analyses, our approach
               offers an optimal partitioning of genes into topics and cells
               into clusters simultaneously, producing easily interpretable
               clustering outcomes. Additionally, we demonstrate that an
               integrative clustering approach, which combines the information

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The development of single-cell RNA sequencing
               (scRNA-seq) has enabled scientists to catalog and probe the
               transcriptional heterogeneity of individual cells in
               unprecedented detail. A common step in the analysis of scRNA-seq
               data is the selection of so-called marker genes, most commonly
               to enable annotation of the biological cell types present in the
               sample. In this paper, we benchmark 59 computational methods for
               selecting marker genes in scRNA-seq data. RESULTS: We compare
               the performance of the methods using 14 real scRNA-seq datasets
               and over 170 additional simulated datasets. Methods are compared
               on their ability to recover simulated and expert-annotated
               marker genes, the predictive performance and characteristics of
               the gene sets they select, their memory usage and speed, and
               their implementation quality. In addition, various case studies
               are used to scrutinize the most commonly used methods,
               highlighting issues and inconsistencies. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
               we present a comprehensive evaluation of methods for selecting
               marker genes in scRNA-seq data. Our results highlight the
               efficacy of simple methods, especially the Wilcoxon rank-sum
               test, Student's t-test, and logistic regression.",

  abstract  = "Tissue-specific patterns of gene expression are fundamental to
               establishing and preserving tissue identity and function, and
               dysregulation of these patterns underlies a wide range of
               diseases. Over the past few years, several large-scale efforts
               driven by the advent of RNA sequencing have established
               resources of gene expression measurements, across both tissues
               and individuals, toward building a comprehensive understanding
               of the specificity and variability of gene expression. We
               summarize these resources, review insights gained into the
               tissue specificity of gene expression across transcript classes,
               including protein-coding and non-coding RNAs, and discuss the
               developments that will be needed to integrate existing and new

               samples and sequencing protocols",
  author    = "Zhao, Shanrong and Ye, Zhan and Stanton, Robert",
  abstract  = "In recent years, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has emerged as a
               powerful technology for transcriptome profiling. For a given
               gene, the number of mapped reads is not only dependent on its
               expression level and gene length, but also the sequencing depth.
               To normalize these dependencies, RPKM (reads per kilobase of
               transcript per million reads mapped) and TPM (transcripts per
               million) are used to measure gene or transcript expression
               levels. A common misconception is that RPKM and TPM values are
               already normalized, and thus should be comparable across samples
               or RNA-seq projects. However, RPKM and TPM represent the
               relative abundance of a transcript among a population of
               sequenced transcripts, and therefore depend on the composition
               of the RNA population in a sample. Quite often, it is reasonable
               to assume that total RNA concentration and distributions are
               very close across compared samples. Nevertheless, the sequenced
               RNA repertoires may differ significantly under different
               experimental conditions and/or across sequencing protocols;
               thus, the proportion of gene expression is not directly
               comparable in such cases. In this review, we illustrate typical
               scenarios in which RPKM and TPM are misused, unintentionally,
               and hope to raise scientists' awareness of this issue when
               comparing them across samples or different sequencing protocols.",

              are distinguished by gene expression patterns, implying that
              distinct regulatory programs control tissue specificity. In this
              study, we investigate gene expression and regulation across 38
              tissues profiled in the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. We
              find that network edges (transcription factor to target gene
              connections) have higher tissue specificity than network nodes
              (genes) and that regulating nodes (transcription factors) are
              less likely to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner as
              compared to their targets (genes). Gene set enrichment analysis
              of network targeting also indicates that the regulation of
              tissue-specific function is largely independent of transcription
              factor expression. In addition, tissue-specific genes are not
              highly targeted in their corresponding tissue network. However,
              they do assume bottleneck positions due to variability in
              transcription factor targeting and the influence of non-canonical
              regulatory interactions. These results suggest that tissue
              specificity is driven by context-dependent regulatory paths,
              providing transcriptional control of tissue-specific processes.",
